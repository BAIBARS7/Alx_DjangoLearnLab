This class contains unit tests for the Book API endpoints, including:
    
    - Test the CRUD operations for the Book model.
    - Test filtering, searching, and ordering of books.
    - Test permission and authentication rules on endpoints.
    
    Each test simulates an API request and checks the response's status code, 
    response data integrity, and the correct functioning of advanced query features.
